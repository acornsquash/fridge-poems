# Fridge Peotry with friends

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Basic Idea

The goal is to create an app simulation of refrigerator poetry (all the joy of random poems without the hassle of your actual roommates!) 
Users will be able to create a new "fridge", share their code with friends, and then log in to create new poems and see what their friends have written 
to create a new poem -- click the magnets to grab a random word from the database, and rearrange the magnets! 


### Stretch goals 

Once everything is up and running, I'd like to experiment with creating a mobile version, probably using React Native.
